# Coding-Journal
A journal-like log documenting my self-taught journey learning how to code


The description line pretty much says it all. This is my coding journal where I document what I do and learn as I teach myself how to code. 

I am mainly working through the Udemy "Web Development Bootcamp", which is taught by Angela Yu - and which is absolutely great! I HIGHLY recommend it!! You learn a TON - and through freeCodeCamp's various certifications.

EVERYONE out there seems to agree that you should keep a coding journal and "learn in public", as they say, so here we go. I initially started keeping a log of sorts about everything I learn in OneNote, which I can recommend whole heartedly because it lets you keep screenshots and take detailed notes, but I want to keep a parallel journal/log (journal sounds very much like "diary", to my ears anyway) and this is going to be focused on coding rather than on "Dear Diary" moments ;)

Today involved travelling back from Georgia to Germany and that meant that I did not have any time to code. So I decided to review the lessons on databases from Udemy. Besides freeCodeCmap, I am also working my way through Udemy's "The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp", which is taught by Angela Yu, and which I really highly recommend. She is GREAT! You learn so much. She goes through front and back end development in a lot of detail with loads of projects you do along the way (I am really fond of this course! It is the one course that has got me stuck with coding) - anyways, during the backend part of the course you learn all about mongoDB and mongoose, so I reviewed all my notes that I was taking while working through the lessons.
