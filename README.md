# Coding-Journal
A journal-like log documenting my self-taught journey learning how to code


The description line pretty much says it all. This is my coding journal where I document what I do and learn as I teach myself how to code. 

I am mainly working through the Udemy "Web Development Bootcamp", which is taught by Angela Yu - and which is absolutely great! I HIGHLY recommend it!! You learn a TON - and through freeCodeCamp's various certifications.

EVERYONE out there seems to agree that you should keep a coding journal and "learn in public", as they say, so here we go. I initially started keeping a log of sorts about everything I learn in OneNote, which I can recommend whole heartedly because it lets you keep screenshots and take detailed notes, but I want to keep a parallel journal/log (journal sounds very much like "diary", to my ears anyway) and this is going to be focused on coding rather than on "Dear Diary" moments ;)
